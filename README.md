# Sort-Number-in-Descending-Order

Sorts the given number typed in by the user in a descending order.

For example, 54321 gives out 12345 as output;

223166 gives out 663221 as output.

Important thing learnt:

-  Scanner.nextInt() or Scanner.next() does not read newline in input created

	 when the user hits enter, therefore we use an extra Scanner.nextLine() before
   
	 we read the actual nextLine so that the extra nextLine() reads that newline
   
	 character in the previous line.
